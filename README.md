* Computer Vision
* OpenCV
* NumPy
* TensorFlow / PyTorch (if applicable)

---

## How It Works

1. Medical images are preprocessed for better clarity
2. AI model analyzes images to identify polyp regions
3. Detected polyps are highlighted in the output
4. Results help in faster and more accurate diagnosis

---

## Applications

* Medical image analysis
* Colonoscopy assistance systems
* Healthcare AI solutions
* Early cancer detection support

---

## Future Enhancements
